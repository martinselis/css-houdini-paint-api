Playing around with Paint API that's provided through CSS Houdini. Uses Canvas to create an image of circles and squares as a background. It's set to body tag, but it can be used in all places where CSS accepts an image (background, borders, list styles).

To run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This should open https://localhost:1234
